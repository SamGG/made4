\title{Produce web page with a 3D graph that can be viewed using Chime web browser plug-in, and/or a
pdb file that can be viewed using Rasmol}
\description{
\code{html3D} produces a pdb file that can be viewed using the freeware protein structure viewer Rasmol
and a html web page with a 3D graph that can be rotated and manipulated in a web browser that 
supports the chime web browser plug-in. 
}
\usage{
html3D(df, classvec = NULL, writepdb = FALSE, filenamebase = "output", 
       writehtml = FALSE, title = NULL, scaled=TRUE,xyz.axes=c(1:3), ...)
}


\arguments{
  \item{df}{A \code{\link{matrix}} or \code{\link{data.frame}} containing the x,y,z coordinates. 
    Typically the output from \code{\link[made4:bga]{bga}} such as the \$ls or \$co files, or other xyz
    coordinates (\$li or \$co) produced by PCA, COA or other \code{\link[ade4:dudi]{dudi}}
    }
  \item{classvec}{\code{factor} or \code{vector} which describes classes in the df. Default is NULL. 
   If specified each group will be coloured in contrasting colours}
  \item{writepdb}{Logical. The default is FALSE. If TRUE a file will be saved which can be read into Rasmol.}
  \item{writehtml}{Logical. The default is FALSE, If TRUE a web html file will be saved which can be 
    viewed in any web browser than supports chime.}
  \item{filenamebase}{Character. The basename of the html or pdb file(s) to be saved. The 
    default is "output", which will save files output.pdb, output.html, if writepdb or writehtml are TRUE respectively.}
  \item{title}{Character, the title (header) of the web page saved if writehtml is TRUE. 
  The default is NULL.}
  \item{scaled}{Logical indicating whether the data should be scaled for best fit. The default is TRUE}
  \item{xyz.axes}{vector indicating which axes to use for x, y and z axes. By default, the first 3 columns of df.}
  \item{\dots}{ further arguments passed to or from other methods }
}
\details{
 Produces a html file, of a 3D graph which can be rotated using the FREEWARE chime (win, MacOS). Chime 
 can be downloaded from  \url{http://www.mdlchime.com/}. 

 \code{html3D} will colour samples by classvec if given one, and will produce chime script to highlight groups, 
 spin on/off, and include button for restore for example see \url{http://bioinf.ucd.ie/research/BGA/supplement.html}

 \code{html3d} calls \code{\link[made4:chime3D]{chime3D}} to produce the html web page with a 3D graph.
}
\value{
\code{html3D} produces the pdb output file which can be read in Rasmol or other molecular structure viewers.
\code{html3D} produces a html file with a 3D graph that can be rotated and manipulated in a web browser that 
supports the chime web browser plug-in.

\note{ 
Note chime is only available on windows or Mac OS currently. Using the chime plug-in on Linux 
is slightly complicated but is available if the CrossOver Plug-in is installed.  
Instructions on installing this and chime on Linux are available at  
\url{http://mirrors.rcsb.org/SMS/STINGm/help/chime_linux.html}

If you wish to view a 3D graph in Rasmol, you will need to execute a Rasmol script similar to 

\preformatted{
load pdbfilename.pdb; 
set axes on; select off; 
connect;set ambient 40; 
rotate x 180; select *;  
spacefill 40
}

\code{html3D} calls \code{chime3D} to produce the html file from the pdb file.
