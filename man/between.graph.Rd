\title{Plot 1D graph of results from between group analysis }
\description{
Plots a 1D graph, of results of between group analysis similar to that in Culhane et al., 2002. 
}
\usage{
between.graph(x, ax=1, cols=NULL, hor=TRUE, ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{Object of the class \code{bga} resulting from a \code{\link[made4:bga]{bga}} analysis. 
   }
  \item{ax}{Numeric. The column number of principal component (\$ls and \$li) to be
    used. Default is 1. This is the first component of the analysis.}
  \item{cols}{Vector of colours. By default colours are obtained
    using \code{\link[made4:getcol]{getcol}} }
  \item{hor}{Logical, indicating whether the graph should be plotted
   horizontally or vertically. The default is a horizontal plot.}
  \item{\dots}{further arguments passed to or from other methods }
}
\details{
This will produce a figure similar to Figure 1 in the paper by Culhane et al., 2002.

\code{between.graph} requires both samples and centroid co-ordinates (\$ls, \$li) which are passed 
to it via an object of class \code{bga}.   If cases are to be coloured by class, it also requires 
a \$fac \code{factor}  which is also passed to it via an object of class \code{bga}.


To plot a 1D graph from other multivariate analysis such as PCA (\code{\link[ade4:dudi.pca]{dudi.pca}}), 
COA (\code{\link[ade4:dudi.coa]{dudi.coa}}), or \code{\link[ade4:coinertia]{coinertia}} analysis. Please 
use \code{\link[made4:graph1D]{graph1D}}.
